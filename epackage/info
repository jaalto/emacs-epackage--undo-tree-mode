Commentary:
Description: treat undo history as a tree
 Undo system based on tree of changes. This simple idea allows the more
 intuitive behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined with
 the power of never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo
 history can in some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more
 changes to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history. Includes
 a undo visualizer buffer from where you can control the undo branches.
